## Estimate carbon revenue from carbon emmission and carbon price

The function get_revenue estimates the revenue from carbon emissions from carbon price. At present this uses an overly simple approach of multiplying the carbon price by the emissions, then reducing by 10% to account for reductions in carbon emissions (see Table 2 in [this]() IMF report).

Here, we estimate revenue for a carbon price of $35 per metric tonne, assuming 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide in emissions.

```{r revenue}
library(carpentr)
get_revenue(35,1000000)
```
